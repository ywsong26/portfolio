This work is named Mindless, recording a person's daily life without thinking. In this era of information explosion, brain receives lots of information from the outside, which sometimes make us to ignore our own thoughts then life is as boring and hopeless as a walking dead. The first five photos record a mindless person doing something. The sixth, "dipping", is about the failure consequences. Overall, the bright colors create a humorous vibe. All the photos were taken from different spots on the same road, but they are connected in the colors. This work can remind people to keep learning and thinking.
